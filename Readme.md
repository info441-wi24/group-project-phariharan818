## Draft proposal 

# Project Description 
This is a written, non-technical description of your project. Depending on the specifics of your project, you should outline the answers to these (and perhaps other) questions:

Who is your target audience?  Who do you envision using your application? Depending on the domain of your application, there may be a variety of audiences interested in using your application.  You should hone in on one of these audiences.
Why does your audience want to use your application? Please provide some sort of reasoning. 
Why do you as developers want to build this application?
Write this as a narrative (no bullet points or tables).

# Technical Description
This section of your proposal is an opportunity to think through the specific technical steps you'll need to complete throughout the project. Please include all of the requirements described below in this section. 

Include an architectural diagram mapping:
1) all client, server, and database components
2) flow of data, and its communication type (websockets? REST API?).

A summary table of user stories (descriptions of the experience a user would want) in a table like below.
P0 means top priority, P1 means the top priority once all P0s are finished, P2 means the top priority when all P0s and P1s are finished, etc.. These priority classifications do not factor into grading. They are more for your own benefit to think about what would be top priorities if you happened to run out of time. The P0s should indicate what would make a Minimum Viable Product (MVP), which is the absolute least you can do and still have something interesting to show off.
For each user story, say who the user is, and what action or outcome the user wants.
For each of your user story, describe in 1-3 sentences what your technical implementation strategy is. Explicitly note in bold which technology you are using (if applicable).
